The Knight Bus
Harry gradually calms down and starts to panic – he just ran away from home after performing accidental, illegal magic.
He's convinced that he's going to be expelled from Hogwarts and starts planning his new life as a fugitive outcast.
But then he spies a giant black dog, which actually makes his situation worse because the darn dog is huge and scary.
But then he trips and throws his wand hand out (just wait, it really does get better) and a giant purple bus appears out of nowhere and nearly mows him down.
No, really, it gets better.
Turns out, this is "the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard" (3.14). Oh, but of course.
Stan and Ernie, the Knight Bus crew, welcome Harry aboard. Harry plays it cool and acts like he meant to summon the bus.
He also tells them his name is Neville Longbottom.
Harry requests transport to Diagon Alley in London and the bus takes off.

On the way, Stan and Ernie gossip to Harry and fill him in on the escaped convict Sirius Black, a lunatic murderer and Voldemort supporter who broke out of the wizarding prison Azkaban recently.
After Harry defeated Voldemort (as a baby), Sirius Black went nuts and blew up a street, killing thirteen people.
Finally, the bus arrives in London and Harry is welcomed to The Leaky Cauldron by Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic.
Stan and Ernie are super excited to learn that "Neville" is actually Harry Potter.
Harry flips out, but Fudge just wanted to make sure he was safe and sound. Fudge assures Harry that he won't be punished for blowing up his aunt.
Harry finds all this really suspicious.
Fudge tells Harry that he can get a room at The Leaky Cauldron and can stay in Diagon Alley for the rest of the summer.
Hedwig shows up, proving how smart she is.
Fudge leaves finally and an exhausted Harry goes to bed.
