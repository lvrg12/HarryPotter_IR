The Firebolt
Harry returns to the castle in shock over what he's heard.
He's angry that no one ever told him the full story.
Harry goes up to his room to look at the photo album Hagrid made for him, full of old pictures of his parents.
He searches through it until he finds his parents' wedding photo. And standing next to his dad is none other than a young and happy Sirius Back.
Harry has nightmares all night about Black.
The next day is the start of the holiday break and the three friends go visit Hagrid.
Harry plans to angrily confront Hagrid about Black.
But Hagrid is so upset when they arrive that Harry doesn't have the heart to do it.
Turns out, Buckbeak has to go on trial for his attack on Malfoy, and Hagrid is really upset.
They agree to help Hagrid with his case, and the project helps distract Harry.
On Christmas morning, the gang check out their presents.
Harry has an anonymous gift that turns out to be a Firebolt broomstick.
The boys flip out in excitement, but Hermione finds the whole thing shifty.
That night, they head down for Christmas dinner with the few other students still at the castle and the professors.
Professor Trelawney decides to join them, after having a vision where she did just that. How convenient.
McGonagall and Trelawney provide the dinner entertainment as they proceed to bicker.
Snape glares at everyone and Dumbledore acts cheerfully oblivious to everyone.
Finally, the world's most awkward dinner ends and Hermione stays behind to chat with McGonagall.
The boys go back to the common room to gaze at the Firebolt some more.
They're about a few minutes away from composing sonnets to it.
But then McGonagall arrives to break up the love fest. She's come to confiscate the Firebolt.
The boys are furious with Hermione and McGonagall.
Hermione defends herself: "Because I thought – and Professor McGonagall agrees with me – that the broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!" (11.2.204).
