The Chamber of Secrets
The next morning, Professor McGonagall announces that exams will be beginning as usual at the beginning of June.
Seamus Finnegan asks how they can possibly have exams with all that's been going on.
Professor McGonagall reminds him that this is a school and they're supposed to be running it as normally as possible. Why else keep Hogwarts open?
Three days before the exams start, Professor McGonagall announces that Professor Sprout is ready to start brewing the Mandrake Restorative Draught.
Everyone starts cheering.
Once the Petrified people wake up, they'll be able to tell who attacked them.
Ginny comes to sit next to Ron at the Gryffindor table.
She looks fearful.
She tells Harry and Ron that she needs to speak to them, but, before she can finish, Percy walks in and interrupts.
Ron scolds Percy, but Percy tells him that it's nothing. Percy seems to think Ginny's secret has to do with him.
Now that the Petrified people are about to wake up, Professor Lockhart doesn't think there's any point in guarding the students between their classes.
Harry and Ron take advantage of his carelessness to sneak down to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
Before they can arrive, though, Professor McGonagall catches them.
Harry lies that they were on their way to see Hermione.
Professor McGonagall seems moved: "Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been…I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger" (16.61).
Madam Pomfrey lets Harry and Ron into the Hospital Wing.
Hermione clearly has no idea that they are there, though: she's frozen.
Harry notices something in Hermione's hand.
It's a piece of paper describing the basilisk: a giant snake that can live hundreds of years.
The basilisk is so deadly that it can kill just by looking at you.
Spiders run away from basilisks, "for it is their mortal enemy"; basilisks run "only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it" (16.72).
