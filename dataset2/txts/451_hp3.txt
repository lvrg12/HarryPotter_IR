This
book was art
directed by David Saylor. The
art for both the jacket and the interior was
created using pastels on toned printmaking paper.
The text was set in 12-point Adobe Garamond, a typeface based
on the sixteenth-century type designs of Claude Garamond, redrawn by
Robert Slimbach in 1989. This book was printed and bound
at Quebecor Martinsburg, in Martinsburg, West
Virginia. The production was supervised by
Angela Biola and Mike
Derevjanik.
